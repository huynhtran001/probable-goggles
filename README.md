# probable-goggles
Personal project on developing a video game using Unity Engine

These are the scripts written in C# that are used to make the game function.

The game is a 2D platformer (similar to Mario). The scripts control everything from
moving the player (and all the small details, such as controlling fall speed, jump
height, changing animations), changing the game settings, levels, and everything
else.
